## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Multimodal Agent
```bash
python multimodal_main.py
```

## Interaction Modes

### Text Only Mode
- Traditional keyboard input

- AI responds with voice
- Completely hands-free experience

### Mixed Mode
- Choose between typing or speaking
- Visual text + audio output
- Best of both worlds

## Voice Interaction Guide

### For User Input:
- **Food**: Say "one", "1", "food", "restaurants", or "dining"

## Implementation Details

### Voice Interaction Implementation

This multimodal agent extends a traditional CrewAI text-based system with comprehensive speech capabilities:

#### 1. **Speech-to-Text (STT) Pipeline**
- **Library**: OpenAI Whisper (`openai-whisper`)
- **Model**: Base model (74MB) for balanced speed/accuracy
- **Audio Capture**: PyAudio for real-time microphone input
- **Processing**: librosa for audio file handling (Windows compatibility fix)
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic speech detection
  - 10-second recording windows with manual interrupt (SPACEBAR)
  - Robust voice choice parsing with multiple recognition patterns
  - Graceful fallback to text input on failure

#### 2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Pipeline**
- **Primary**: Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for high-quality, natural voice
- **Fallback**: pyttsx3 for offline capability using system voices
- **Audio Playback**: pygame mixer for reliable MP3 playback
- **Key Features**:
  - Consecutive speech handling with proper timing delays
  - Smart text cleaning (removes markdown, emojis for better speech)
  - 120-second timeout handling for long content
  - Fresh engine creation to prevent conflicts

#### 3. **Integration Architecture**
- **Framework**: CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration
- **Agents**: Two sequential agents (Self-introduction + Boston Guide)
- **Modes**: Three interaction paradigms (text-only, voice-only, mixed)
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent responses

### Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Windows Whisper Compatibility**: Used librosa with numpy arrays instead of file paths
2. **Consecutive TTS Issues**: Implemented proper delays and engine cleanup
3. **Audio Timing**: Added timeout detection and buffer delays between speech segments
4. **Voice Input Parsing**: Multi-pattern recognition for natural voice commands

## Example Run Analysis

### Scenario: Mixed Mode Food Recommendations

**Input Sequence:**
1. **Mode Selection**: User types "3" (Mixed mode)
2. **Welcome Message**: System speaks and print personalized greeting
3. **Choice Prompt**: System asks for recommendation type via voice and text
4. **User Voice Input**: "2" (requesting activities)
5. **Processing**: CrewAI agents generate personalized content

**System Output:**

**Key Insights Observed:**

1. **Natural Conversation Flow**: The system maintains context between voice interactions, creating a seamless conversational experience rather than disconnected commands.

2. **Robust Voice Recognition**: Successfully parsed "Three!" as choice 3 (both recommendations) despite casual pronunciation, demonstrating effective intent recognition.

3. **Personalization**: The AI agents reference Tong's introduction when explaining recommendations, showing contextual awareness across agent interactions.

4. **Technical Reliability**: gTTS handled long-form content (60+ second introduction) without timeout issues after optimization, proving suitable for extended multimodal interactions.

5. **User Experience**: Adding voice functionality makes interactions more natural, accessible, and immersive, allowing users to engage hands-free and feel more connected to the system.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: 100% for clear speech in quiet environment
- **TTS Quality**: Near-human naturalness with gTTS vs. robotic pyttsx3
- **Response Time**: ~15 seconds from voice input to full recommendation delivery
- **System Reliability**: Graceful degradation with multiple fallback mechanisms

This example demonstrates successful multimodal AI interaction where speech becomes the primary interface, maintaining the intelligence and personalization of the original text-based system while adding natural voice capabilities.

## AI usage
During this project, I used GPT to enhance readability by adding emojis to the recommendations for better visualization. I also used Claude during debugging to speed up troubleshooting.
